Nested Grover's Algorithm  for Tree Search

We investigate optimizing quantum tree search algorithms by employing a nested Grover Algorithm. This approach seeks to enhance results compared to previous Grover-based methods by expanding the tree of partial assignments to a specific depth and conducting a quantum search within the subset of remaining assignments. The study explores the implications and constraints of this approach, providing a foundation for quantum artificial intelligence applications.
Instead of utilizing conventional heuristic functions that are incompatible with quantum tree search, we introduce the partial candidate solution, which indicates a node at a specific depth of the tree. By employing such a function, we define the concatenated oracle, which enables us to decompose the quantum tree search using Groverâ€™s algorithm.
