Nested Grover's Algorithm  for Tree Search

See the paper at: http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07041

We investigate optimizing quantum tree search algorithms by employing a nested Grover Algorithm. This approach seeks to enhance results compared to previous Grover-based methods by expanding the tree of partial assignments to a specific depth and conducting a quantum search within the subset of remaining assignments. The study explores the implications and constraints of this approach, providing a foundation for quantum artificial intelligence applications.
Instead of utilizing conventional heuristic functions that are incompatible with quantum tree search, we introduce the partial candidate solution, which indicates a node at a specific depth of the tree. By employing such a function, we define the concatenated oracle, which enables us to decompose the quantum tree search using Groverâ€™s algorithm.


The software runs with qiskit 2.2. If you have an older version

and get an error at result=simulator.run(qc.decompose().decompose(),shots=10000).result() 

just add another decompose(), if still the error is present, add another decompose() repeat till error disappears.
